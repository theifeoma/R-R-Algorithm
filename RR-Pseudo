Pseudo Code

-Initialize variables
-Test for the number of parameters


-Test if parameter is a file
-Read file and store in three different arrays
-Define function to check if all processes are done running so that program can terminate.
-Loop through program
  -Loop through number of processes 
    -Add to queue if arrival time = time
  -Check if arrival time > time and nut > 0
    -Status initialized to “not in system”
  -Check if queue is not empty and nut of process is > 0
    -Check if process is not in front of queue
      -Status is set to waiting
    -Check if process is in front of queue and nut of process > 0
      -Status is set to running
        -Check if quanta is greater than nut
          -nut of process = 0
          -else decrement nut by quanta value
    -Check if arrival time is less than 0 and nut > 0
      -Status is set to finished
  -Print current time and corresponding status
  -If current index of nut > 0
    -Add process to back of queue
    -Else remove from queue
  -Check if all processes are finished
  -Increment time
  -If nut of all processes = 0
    -Print time and “F” for all processes
    -Exit program
-Done
